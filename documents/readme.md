## How can I create different sized headings?

To make a heading you can simply type `#` then the heading. By default the normal heading is 30px but each time you add a `#` (example `## Heading`) it will shrink by 4px. You have a choice of five different headings.

```python
# Heading One
## Heading Two
### Heading Three
#### Heading Four
##### Heading Five
```

## How do I make a list in Mdote?

To make a list you can simply type `-`, `+` or `*` then a space following the item within the list to create bullets like so:

```md
"-" will start a list item
"+" this will also start a list item
"\*" this will also start a item
```

So you can create a simplistic list like and it will look like so:

- Hello World
- This is a new list

## Some other useful features within Mdote

> You can create a blockquotes:

```md
> adding ">" will create a blockquote
```

You can also create table of contents quickly. Here is an example below.

```md
# Table Of Contents

1. [About](#about)
2. [Hello World](#hello-world)

## About

This is the about section. The table of contents will automatically link to this section if the about link is clicked

## Hello World
```

## How can I make things bold or italic?

You can simply add wrap a word with double asterisk `*` to change the font to bold or a single asterisk for italic.

**Here** is an _example_:

```md
**strong**
*italic*
_italic_ works too!
```
